# NYC_tree_analysis

In this project, I construct exploratory analysis, feature engineer, model evaluation as well as the importance feature analysis. I tried different models to classify and predict the health conditions of NYC trees. By comparing model with RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error) and accuracy, I chose a model perform the best and then analyzed some of the critical factors that influence on environment.
